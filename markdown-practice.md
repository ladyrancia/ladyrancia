#  About Me  #
I’m someone who thinks differently, ~~thinks alot about the world around me~~,scratch that,
notices what others overlook, and isn’t afraid to question the norm. I dream big, learn fast,
and push myself *(even when things get messy)*. I’m not perfect, but I own who I am and the path I’m on.
And today i learned execution of *hello world* using javaScript its as simple as: 
               ``` JavaScript
               console.log("Hello World");
               ```
